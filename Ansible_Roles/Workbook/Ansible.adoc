== Ansible Roles

Ansible roles ... blah blah blah

=== Creating a Github repository for an Ansible Role

The first step in the creation of an  Ansible role for publishing is to create a Github repository to house the role and use the *ansible-galaxy init* command to initialize the proper directory structure.

. Create and Define the Ansible ROLE and Github Repository
+
.Initializing an Ansible Role
[source,bash]
----
[student@workstation github]$ ansible-galaxy init Demo_Role
- Demo_Role was created successfully
----
+
.Initializing a Git Repository
[source,bash]
----
[student@workstation github]$ cd Demo_Role/

[student@workstation Demo_Role]$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/student/github/Demo_Role/.git/
----
+
.Add Files to Local Repository
[source,bash]
----
[student@workstation Demo_Role]$ git add .

[student@workstation Demo_Role]$ git commit -m "Added Role Structure"
[master (root-commit) 5c12d1a] Added Role Structure
 8 files changed, 106 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
 create mode 100644 defaults/main.yml
 create mode 100644 handlers/main.yml
 create mode 100644 meta/main.yml
 create mode 100644 tasks/main.yml
 create mode 100644 tests/inventory
 create mode 100644 tests/test.yml
 create mode 100644 vars/main.yml
----

.Local GIT Repository vs. Github Repository
[IMPORTANT]
====
At this point, the repository that has been created is a local *git* repository. It is necessary to create a *New Repository* on Github and connect the local repository to Github
====

. Login to Github and click "New" to create a new repository
+
image::Ansible-56a4b.png[title="Github New Repository", align="center"]

. Provide a *Name* for the repository *ONLY* but do not initialize as you are going to be linking a local repository. It is also OK to provide *Description* for this repository. Then click *Create Repository*
+

+
.Github Repository Quick Setup
[TIP]
====
Github will provide you with a *Quick Setup* set of instructions. These are basic instructions that can be used to import/connect an existing local *git* repository.

image::Ansible-bcaca.png[title="Github Quick Setup", align="center"]
====

. Link your local GIT repository to Github by using *git add origin* and *git push origin master* commands.
+
[source,bash]
----
[student@workstation Demo_Role]$ git remote add origin git@github.com:tmichett/Demo_Role.git

[student@workstation Demo_Role]$  git push -u origin master

----

. Verify that the initial contents were loaded to Github by refreshing the web browser

==== Creating an Ansible Role for Publishing

After the creating a Github repository has been created along with the initial Ansible role structure created by the *ansible-galaxy* command, it is now time to take existing playbooks to break down into tasks and other sections to create the role or create the role from scratch.

.Role Creation
[NOTE]
====
I find that it is easier to create a role from an existing playbook and to break the playbook down into modules. Remember that Ansible roles and playbooks are supposed to be simple and easy to follow. An Ansible Role especially should be a simple role to accomplish a given outcome and the role should be broken down and easy to use. There are always trade-offs with this process as well as the *Ansiblize Role* we are looking at could be broken down into smaller roles:

* Create and Setup the User (user creation, password file, SSH keys, SUDOERS file)
* Configure SSHD

However, since I wanted a single role to perform a single *main* task, I decided not to break the larger *Ansiblize Role* into two smaller roles.
====

*Creating the Ansible Role*

The preferred method to create an Ansible role would be to start from a working playbook and to create the various role components. At a minimum, there should be a tasks section. After the various role components have been created with their corresponding *main.yml* files, any unused directories should be removed from the role. It is also very important for *Ansible Galaxy* to have the role created with a proper *README* file and *meta* files so that it will be scored a *5/5* on https://galaxy.ansible.com.

.Ansiblize.YML Playbook
[TIP]
====
For this demonstration, we will be taking the link:https://github.com/tmichett/LUG/blob/main/Ansible_Roles/Playbooks/Ansiblize.yml[Ansiblize Playbook] and turning it into an Ansible Role. This workshop has the complete playbook as well as the individual components broken down for ease of use and implementation. The individual components are located at link:https://github.com/tmichett/LUG/tree/main/Ansible_Roles/Playbooks/Playbook_Components[Playbook Components]. The steps below demonstrate how to create the various files required for the Ansible role.
====

. Create and copy the Ansible tasks into the *tasks/main.yml*
+
.*tasks/main.yml* File
[source,yaml]
----
---
### Create the Ansible User
- name: Create Ansible User
  user:
    name: "{{ ansible_user_name }}"
    state: present
    shell: /bin/bash
    comment: Ansible User for System


### Create the Ansible User
- name: Create Ansible User Password (if required)
  shell: echo {{ ansible_user_password }} | passwd {{ ansible_user_name }} --stdin

### Copy Ansible User Public SSH Keys (if defined)
### This will take the public key and set as the authorized_key from the current user
### Only works if the current user/remote user is the same as user being created
- name: Copy Ansible User SSH Keys
  authorized_key:
    user: "{{ ansible_user_name }}"
    state: present
    key: "{{ lookup('file', lookup('env','HOME') + '/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"
  when: ssh_key_file_data is not defined and ssh_key_answer

### Copy Ansible User Public SSH Keys from file (if defined)
### This will take the public key specified and set as and authorized_key for the user specified
- name: Copy Ansible User SSH Keys
  authorized_key:
    user: "{{ ansible_user_name }}"
    state: present
    key: "{{ ssh_key_file_data }}"
  when: ssh_key_file_data is defined

### Modify Sudoers to Allow Passwordless SUDO
- name: Create Ansible User SUDOERS Entry
  copy:
    content: "{{ ansible_user_name }} ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\n"
    dest: /etc/sudoers.d/{{ ansible_user_name }}

### Modify SSH_CONFIG to prevent Root Login
- name: Prevent Root Login via SSH (if required)
  lineinfile:
    path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    regexp: '^PasswordAuthentication'
    line: PasswordAuthentication {{ ssh_passwords_allowed }}
    backup: yes
  notify:
    - Restart SSHD Test

### Modify SSH_CONFIG to permit SSH Key ONLY Access (no passwords)
- name: Prevent Root Login via SSH (if required)
  lineinfile:
    path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    regexp: '^PermitRootLogin'
    line: PermitRootLogin {{ ssh_root_allowed }}
    backup: yes
  notify:
    - Restart SSHD

### Test the SSHD Config File
### Technically this will exit out and break the Ansible playbook if it fails
- name: Test SSHD Config File
  shell: sshd -t
  register: sshd_results

### Test the SSHD Config File
- name: Test SSHD Config File Debug Output
  debug:
    msg: The SSHD_CONFIG file is broken. Please fix the file as there is an issue with either the line with "PermitRootLogin" or the line with "PasswordAuthentication". The specific issue is {{ sshd_results.stderr_lines }}
  when: sshd_results.rc != 0
----

. Create and copy the Handler into the *handlers/main.yml* file
+
.*handlers/main.yml*
[source,yaml]
----
---
- name: Restart SSHD
  systemd:
    name: sshd
    state: restarted
  when: sshd_results.rc==0

. Create and copy the Variables into the *defaults/main.yml* file
+
.*defaults/main.yml*
[source,yaml]

ansible_user_name: ansible-user
ansible_user_password: redhat

Ansiblize Systems
=========

This role is meant to setup and create an Ansible user with a username, password, SSH key, and to add the user to the SUDOERS file with password-less sudo access.

Requirements
------------

This role assumes that you are operating on an EL-based Linux distribution utilizing SystemD.

Role Variables
--------------

**pkg_name** - This variable is the name of the package or a list of package names that can be installed on the system. This is the "ONLY" required variable to be supplied.

**pkg_state** - This variable is a default variable and set to "latest". The allowed values for this variable are "latest" and "present" to install the package(s) or "absent" to ensure that the package has been removed.

Dependencies
------------

There are no dependencies for this playbook, but there is another related role published to work with Linux services.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:



    ---
    - name: Install Software Packages
      hosts: serverc
      vars:
        pkg_name:
          - vim
          - tree
          - httpd
      roles:
        - tmichett.deploy_packages

=== Publishing Ansible Roles to Ansible Galaxy

One the role has been created and tested thoroughly, it can be shared through Ansible Galaxy. Again, this assumes that you've already setup an account with Github and linked that account to your Ansible Galaxy account.

. Login to Ansible Galaxy
+
image::Ansible-f2143.png[title="Ansible Galaxy Home", align="center"]

. Select your *My Content* (*Namespaces*) selection from the side navigation menu and click "*Add Content*"
+
image::Ansible-5c183.png[title="Ansible Galaxy Content", align="center"]

. Click *Import Role from Github*
+
image::Ansible-6edd9.png[title="Ansible Galaxy Content Import", align="center"]

. Locate and select the Github repository containing the role you wish to import. _(Make use of the filter to assist in locating the correct repository)_. Once you've located the correct repository, place a *checkmark* in the box and then click "*OK*".
+
image::Ansible-ad465.png[title="Ansible Galaxy Import Role from Github", align="center"]

. The role import process will begin and Ansible Galaxy will automatically perform validation and linting on the imported role and components. You can click the *>* beside your Ansible Galaxy ID or the Ansible Galaxy Team ID (_depending on where you imported the roles_) to expand the list of roles.
+

.Ansible Galaxy Content Provider Namespaces
[TIP]
====
In this demo, I have two (2) *Ansible Galaxy Content Provider Namespaces*. One of these is my personal namespace *tmichett* and the other is where I'm a member of Red Hat Consulting. Most likely you will have a single Namespace.
====
+
.Warning Header
[WARNING]
====
You will want to check the status of your imported Role and see what type of score it received. Ideally, you should be receiving a score of 5/5 meaning that at least all role components were imported successfully and passed the *linting* process and there were no errors that could be picked up from an automated scan process.
====

. After importing the role, check the *score* and look for anything that can be fixed easily and re-published/re-processed to Ansible Galaxy. Select the role to receive more information. Click the *Show Details* for the *Quality Score* to get a breakdown of what may need to be fixed.
+
image::Ansible-5276d.png[title="Ansible Galaxy - Role Details", align="center"]
image::Ansible-d14d5.png[title="Ansible Galaxy - Role Details (Quality Score Details - Shown)", align="center"]

. Resolve issues with role and commit changes to Github. Then return to Ansible Galaxy and re-process the role.

.DEMO Role Note
[NOTE]
====
In this example, I created the initial Ansible Role and pushed to Github, but I neglected to commit and push any of the changes and the actual role into the Github repository. The import into *Ansible Galaxy* imported just the role skeleton which was created using the *ansible-galaxy init* command.
====

. Import/Replace the role in Ansible Galaxy using the *Import* button listed by the role.
+
image::Ansible-47a84.png[title="Refreshing Role from Github Repository", align="center"]
+
.Refreshing the Role
[NOTE]
====
The refresh process will perform the linting and verification process again as the role is imported/updated in Ansible Galaxy. This will create a new score which will hopefully achieve the 5/5 score on quality. Keep in mind, this score doesn't track how good/useful the role is, but more that it conforms to 100% Ansible Galaxy standards and that no required options are missing.

image::Ansible-11ac9.png[title="Ansible Galaxy - Quality Score Updated", align="center"]
image::Ansible-7dd11.png[title="Ansible Galaxy - Quality Score Updated (Details)", align="center"]

In this instance, some of the items found are around choices for implementation of tasks using modules such as *shell* and *command* that are not idempotent. The modules were used to achieve specific functions and are considered fine for the implementation of this role. There are other modules that could be used for the password functionality, but this method is the simplest illustration of Ansible and how to create roles.
